          <h3>Introductory material</h3>
            <p>
              OK, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of that boring Mojo site. I want to build something that's useful to me (or us). So, I'm thinking, <em>let's build a website for the pre-work</em>. We can go through the process step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
              At ﬁrst, at least, it will just be an old-fashioned static website. But maybe later we'll add some CoffeeScript and jQuery and have some fun. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="getting-started">
          <h3>Hooray! So how do we get started?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, the ﬁrst thing we need to do is to ﬁgure out what our site will do, and who it will do it for.
            </p>
            <p>
              To this end, we'll begin by creating <em>personas</em> for our audience. I can think of three different types of user who we might want to serve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously, there are the <strong>students</strong>: you. You are the primary audience as you'll be doing the lessons, so the site should put your needs foremost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then there are the <strong>instructors</strong>, who are also the authors and editors of the content. We'll need to think about them a bit, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we might want to show the site off to others: friends, family, the course manager,curriculum folks, etc. Let's call them <strong>guests</strong>. So we should at least consider their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we'll create three <em>personas</em> &mdash;student, instructor, and guest &mdash;one for each type of user.
            </p>

          <h3>Great! How do we build a persona, then?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, there's an excellent explanation on the <a href="http://usability.gov">usability.gov</a> website, so rather than reinvent the wheel here, we'll just link to that. Go check it out, then come back and we'll build our personas.

          <h3>Should we really use personas?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, that seems a funny question to ask at this juncture. I mean, we just spent a bunch of time making them up (well, I did, anyway). Now we're not going to use them?
            </p>

            <p>
              Heh, heh. Not so fast! We might use them, and we might not. It was important to create them if for no other reason than because there is a very good chance that whatever job you take in the webdev world, you're going to encounter them. Better to know how to make them.
            </p>

            <p>
              But there is a minority of developers who think that personas are a <em>bad idea</em>, and they make some very good points. One of the best points is that the personas are <em>made up</em>, and because we are just making them up, we tend ﬁll them with our own <em>stereotypes</em> of our users and then fool ourselves into thinking that we know something about our users!
            </p>

            <p>
              Gosh, who would do a thing like that? Oh. Yeah. Everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once the personas have been created, most developers will create <em>user stories</em> next. But these, too, have their detractors. Let's look at a couple of different ways to create user stories, and then see how else we might solve the same problem.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="whats-the-story">
          <h3>So what's the story?</h3>
            <p>
              We need some way to come up with a speciﬁcation for our website. One of the biggest mistakes that most newbie developers (and many who really oughta know better) make is to jump straight into coding.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you will soon discover&mdash;if you haven't already&mdash;the compulsion to do this is almost irresistible. I&mdash;cough, cough&mdash;may have even done it myself on occasion.
            </p>

            <p>
              But jumping straight to the code is what we in the biz call a Very Bad Idea™. Just. Don't. Do. It.
            </p>

            <p>
              What's the point of spending a lot of time writing code if you're just going to end up throwing it all away and redoing it?
            </p>

            <p>Here's the right way to build a website or Web application:</p>

            <ol>
              <li> Determine who your primary audiences are and what they want (Personas? Maybe.)</li>
              <li> Determine what your site/application needs to do to meet their needs (User stories? Job stories? Hmm. We'll see.)</li>
              <li>Wireframe out the ﬁrst few pages</li>
              <li>Get buy in from the stakeholders</li>
              <li>Now, and only now, write a little bit of code, then iterate through the above again.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              This iterative process (called the Agile Method) allows us to make sure that all the stakeholders are involved at every step of the process, and that mistakes are discovered and corrected quickly. We'll be talking a lot about Agile during WDI. Wait! Talking? We'll be doing Agile. Daily.

          <h3>Well, what do these stories look like?</h3>
          <dl class="story-types">
            
            <dt>The original format from 2001 looked like this:</dt>
            <dd>As a [role], I want [goal/desire] so that [beneﬁt]</dd>

            <dt>Here's an example (from Wikipedia):</dt>
            <dd> As a student, I want to see estimated times for completion, so that I may schedule my lesson better.</dd>

            <dt>Some developers have a problem with this format, however. They think that the beneﬁt should come ﬁrst (calling it &ldquo;unting the value&rdquo;), so they swap it around:</dt>
            <dd> In order to [receive beneﬁt] as a [role], I want [goal/desire]</dd>

            <dt>Now we have:</dt>
            <dd>So that I may schedule my lessons better, as a student, I want to see estimated times for completion</dd>

            <dt>That worked for a number of years. Then some smart guy pointed out that if you drop the role part, you don't really lose anything. And then that lead to yet another idea, that of the job story. The job story follows this format:</dt>
            <dd>When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]</dd>

            <dt>Here's our user story rewritten as a job story:</dt>
            <dd>When I start a lesson, I want to know how long it will take to complete it, so that I can schedule my time appropriately.</dd>

              The truth is this: it probably doesn't matter. What is most important here is to stimulate discussion involving all the stakeholders&mdash;including, if possible, the users themselves&mdash;so that the speciﬁcation&mdash;the feature set&mdash;is as complete and correct as possible
            </p>
            <p>
              Building the pre-work website is an Agile process—an iterative process—so why not write a few of your own user or job stories? After all, you are the intended users. Send yours to <a href="mailto:charles.munat@generalassemb.ly">charles.munat@generalassemb.ly</a> and maybe they'll be incorporated into the site's UX. Stranger things have happened...

              Of course you can just jump into the coding. All shitty web developers do. Just admit that you suck, and you can skip all these formalities. Unfortunately, if "suck" is not the adjective you had in mind to describe your skill set, well, no, you can't really skip these steps.
